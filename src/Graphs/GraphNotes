UNDIRECTED GRAPH

GRAPH WHERE EDGES ARE NOT DIRECTED, FOR EG EDGE OF 1 TO 4, 1 CAN REACH 4 AND 4 CAN REACH 1

DIRECTED GRAPH

GRAPH WHERE EDGES ARE DIRECTED, FOR EG EDGE OF 1 -> 4, 1 CAN REACH 4 BUT 4 CAN'T REACH 1

CYCLIC GRAPH

WHERE YOU START FROM A NODE AND CAN REACH THAT NODE

PATH

CONTAINING NODES WHERE EACH OF THE NODE IS REACHABLE AND NO NODE IS REPEATING

INDEGREE

NUMBER OF INCOMING EDGES TO A NODE

OUTDEGREE

NUMBER OF OUTGOING EDGES FROM A NODE

GRAPH REPRESENTATION IN JAVA

DONE USING ADJACENCY MATRIX(2D ARRAY) OR ADJACENCY LIST(LIST OF LIST)

IF INDEXING IS 1 BASED, SIZE OF BOTH WOULD BE N+1, GIVEN AN EDGES FOR EG 1 2, THEN FOR AN UNDIRECTED GRAPH ADJACENCY MATRIX
ARR[1][2] = 1 AND ARR[2][1] = 1, SINCE ADJ MATRIX TAKES BIG O(N*N) SO WE USUALLY DON'T USE THIS FOR BIGGER GRAPH

BFS

IN BFS WE GO LEVEL BY LEVEL, WE START WITH THE ROOT AND TRAVERSE USING QUEUE, WE USE A VISIT ARRAY TO MARK THE VISIT SO THAT WE
DON'T ADD IT AGAIN IN QUEUE.

DFS

IN DFS WE GO DEPTH WISE, WE USE RECURSION FOR DFS
