         *

         * OPTIMAL APPROACH
         *
         * WE WILL USE A HASHMAP,
         *
         * APPROACH WHENEVER OUR SUM BECOMES 0, WE ADD MAX VALUE AS I+1, WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE RUNNING FROM 0 TO N-1
         * EVERYTIME WHEN SUM IS ZERO WE KNOW FOR SURE IT IS MAX VALUE AS IT IS FROM START.
         *
         * EVERY TIME WE GET A SUM VALUE PRESENT IN HASHMAP WE CAN EVALUATE THAT
         *
         * EG SUM FROM 0 TO 2 INDEX IS 1 2 3, AND IF NEXT VALUE COMES AS 2, WE KNOW FOR SURE THERE WERE VALUES
         * THAT WOULD COMPUTE TO ZERO, EG 1 1 1 -1, AS WE CAN SEE 2ND AND 3RD INDEX MAKES A 0 HENCE WE ARE SURE,
         * THAT FROM THE LAST SUM VALUE, WHICH WAS 2 FROM 1ST INDEX, SUBTRACTING THIS FROM I, WE WILL GET
         * A SUBARRAY WHICH IS 0
         *
         * EVERYTIME WE GET A SUM VALUE WHICH ISNT ZERO NEITHER IT IS PRESENT IN MAP, WE WILL PUT IT INTO MAP
