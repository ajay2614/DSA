         * FOUR ELEMENTS MUST BE UNIQUE AND ALSO WE CAN'T REPEAT THE SERIES AGAIN.
         *
         * THE EASIEST SOLUTION IS ALSO THE MOST OPTIMAL SOLUTION IN THIS
         *
         * APPROACH, WE WILL SORT THE ARRAY FIRST, THEN WE WILL RUN A I * J LOOP, AND INSIDE J LOOP WE WILL RUN
         * A LEFT AND RIGHT POINTER APPROACH WHICH WILL COLLECT THE 3RD AND 4TH ELEMENT FOR US EQUALLING TARGET
         *
         * STEPS
         *
         * RUN I LOOP FROM O -> N
         * RUN J LOOP FROM I+1 -> N
         * HAVE A DUMMY TARGET WHICH IS ACTUAL TARGET - ARR[I] - ARR[J], BECAUSE WE WOULD BE USING THIS TARGET TO FIND THE 3RD AND
         * 4TH ELEMENT
         * RUN LEFT AND RIGHT POINTER FROM J+1 TO N, NOW IF DUMMY TARGET IS SMALLER THAN ARR[LEFT] + ARR[RIGHT], MEANS ELEMENT
         * IS SMALLER AND IS ON LEFT OR ELEE ITS ON RIGHT IF ITS GREATER, MOVE RIGHT POINTER FOR SMALLER AND LEFT FOR GREATER
         * IF IT IS NEITHER MEANS WE FOUND THE ANSWER, ADD ALL THE 4 ELEMENTS IN ARRAY LIST, NOW WE KNOW WE CANT HAVE SAME SERIES
         * AGAIN, HENCE WE WILL INCREMENT LEFT TILL A NEW ELEMENT IS THERE, SIMILARLY DECREMENT RIGHT TILL NEW ELEMENT IS THERE
         *
         * AFTER COMING OUT OF THIS WHILE LOOP, THAT IS WHEN LEFT IS EQUAL TO RIGHT, WE WILL ALSO DO RUN A WHILE LOOP FOR J
         * SO WE POINT TO THAT ELEMENT WHICH IS UNIQUE AND NOW SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS, EG 2 2 2 3, THEN WE NEED TO GET THIS TO 3,
         * WE USE J+1 TO COMPARE BECAUSE J++ WOULD INCREASE J IN NEXT INCREMENT.
         *
         * DO THE SAME FOR I.
